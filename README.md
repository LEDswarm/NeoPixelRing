# A custom NeoPixel ring for LEDswarm controllers

This repository contains the 3D model, schematic and PCB design of the circular NeoPixel boards designed for use with the LEDswarm controller enclosure. The design is inspired by NeoPixel Jewels, except this a special daughter board designed to mate with controller mainboards within [the 3D-printed enclosure](https://github.com/LEDswarm/enclosure).
